This repository contains all my work for challenges related to
[FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com).

FreeCodeCamp is an online community and curriculum for learning Software / Web
Development via interactive challenges as well as real-world experience.

The code on this site is free to use. However, **if you are a student of
FreeCodeCamp**, you are doing yourself a huge dis-service by copying code from
this repository.
